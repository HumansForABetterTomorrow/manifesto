# National Bank
The National Bank will be a new Government Owned, Controlled and Operated bank. This bank will have two main functions, firstly it will provide the basic "National Accounts" that each citizen must have. All Government to citizen transitions will happen on these accounts and all UK companies will be required to make payments to a citizens into their NBA. Taxation calculations will be based on the this account ledger. All companies resident and trading in the UK will be required to have an National Business Bank Account (NBBA)

## Proposal
We propose the creation of a National Bank, this bank will issue an account to all citizen and some non citizens. This bank will function for the most part as normal bank account. All payments to UK Citizens must be paid into this National Bank Account (NBA), from there payments may be move to any traditional account if desired. Citizens may have more than one NBA if they desire and The National Bank will offer services to customers in line with traditional banking services.

Payments into NBA's will form an official "Tax Ledger" and will allow in real time Citizens to specify the taxation status of payments. This has a number of advantages, firstly untaxed income can be declared and the correct designation can be retained and paid in real time and like wise, income and in real time be defined as already taxed removing the need for tax returns. Citizens will also be able to see all tax transactions and petition any discrepancies also in real time.

All these rules will also apply to all companies trading within the UK, they will have to in real time designate the tax status of income on a ledge shared with the Government, this will help reduce tax fraud and tax evasion.

The National Bank will also establish and manage a "Sovereign Investment Fund" this will be a fund for the UK people, where sovereign capital will be invested and the returns used to fund public goods and services as needed.

Access to all NBA's will require a National Identity Card. This will provide access to a fully featured online management tool, akin to traditional online banking.

The National Bank will assume full responsibility for all UK Tax Revenue and will replace HMRC.
