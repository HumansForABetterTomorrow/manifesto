# Basic Income
Basic income sits at the heart of HFABT's ideals to ensure we transition peacfully into a future where technology and intelligent machines replace the lion share of the jobs that people hold dear and rely on.

The basic premise of Basic Income or "Universal Basic Income" as its sometimes known is to give every citizen (and some none citizens, such as refugees) a monthly payment, much like a salary, that is available to ALL and isn't means tested, that means regardless of your income or employment status everybody will get the same monthly payment to cover all of your essential living costs.

A safety net like this has a number of perks, firstly it removes the stress imposed my the creeping of technology and intelligent machines into more and more jobs and provides a way for people to transition to either a "Post Work" lifestyle or relearn new skills while still providing for themselves and their loved ones.

Basic Income also allows for a much more streamlined approach to state benefits and assistance as all of the current state programs would be disbanded in favour of this new, more fair and more streamlined approach and there is no means test and no requirements to be vetted or managed the distribution and management of BI comes a much reduced cost. The system is also much fairer as everybody, no matter their circumstance is entitled to the same payments.

## Proposal
We are proposing a monthly payment to all UK Citizens, resident within the UK for a period of at least 6 months per calender year. This payment will be non means tested. The amount of the payment will be based on "Schedule 1" and will be paid on the 1st of each calendar monthly directly into the citizens "National Bank Account" (see [National Bank Accounts](./National Bank/README.md#NBA))

We proposal the abolition of all personal Government Subsidies, Tax Credits, Welfare and Social Security payments and the disbanding of all agencies, institutions and ministries who administer and manage all such payments. (see [Depreciates](#Depreciates) for a list of abolishments)

We propose that the state pension be replaced by an additional entry on the schedule. This proposal will not effect any civil servant pension or state pension in a special category, such as the military pension.

## Costings
The full costings for the proposal will be broken down in a separate costing sheet within the budget (see [Budget](./Budget/README.md)) but the bulk of the income require will come from the efficiency savings of reducing agency involvement and a new "Robot Tax" imposed on Business and Industry.

The calculations for payments under the basic income program will be reviewed and new schedules proposed every 18 months, with any updated to the schedule becoming active no later than 6 months after the revised schedule is proposed.

The schedule for payments will be multipliers of the "Basic Income Fixed Base Rate" which will be set at 5x the mean average weekly earnings (AWE) for the 12 month period from 1st Jan 2016 to 31st Dec 2016, this value will update once a year by at least the half the value of the CPI for the previous 12 months.

The starting Basic Income Fixed Base Rate is (£2516)

## Dependancies
This proposal requires that the "National Bank" proposal has been completed before it can be began.
